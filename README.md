###### Data

You will first want to set up a Data folder (stored in ````Stormbot.Helpers.Constants.DataFolderDir````). 

Then, in the data folder, create a file named ````config-common.json```` and fill it with information in the given json format:
````
{
  // only if using audio
  "FfmpegDir"        : "",
  "FfprobeDir"       : "", 
  "SoundcloudApiKey" : "",
  "LivestreamerDir"  : "",
  
  // only if using the twitch bridge
  "TwitchOauth"      : "",
  "TwitchUsername"   : "",
  
  "PastebinApiKey"   : "",
  "PastebinUsername" : "",
  "PastebinPassword" : ""
}

````

After that you'll need a ```` credentials.json ```` file in this format:
````
{
	  "Email"            : "",
    "Password"         : ""
}
````

Compile the bot, and run it.
Then you will want to give it the owner id, stored in ````Stormbot.Helpers.Constants.UserOwner````. You can use the !whoami command to find out your user id.
